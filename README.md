The Volunteer Management System database is designed to support the coordination, assignment, and management of volunteers for various events hosted by organizations. It centralizes volunteer information, event details, time tracking, and certifications, ensuring smooth and efficient volunteer operations. 

### Overview
Admin users manage the system, overseeing volunteer assignments, event planning, and certification issuance. The database structure ensures that admins have access to all necessary data, including volunteer profiles, event schedules, participation records, and certification details. The system also allows admins to generate reports on volunteer efforts, monitor hours worked, and manage any volunteer-related issues that arise during or after events.

Organizations use the system to:
- Post volunteer opportunities.
- Manage event details and volunteer assignments.
- Set limits on the number of volunteers per event, define registration deadlines, and oversee volunteer participation logistics.

The system tracks:
- Hours worked by each volunteer.
- Volunteer participation in real-time.
- Generates participation records to evaluate contributions and ensure smooth event operations.

Volunteers interact with the system by:
- Browsing available volunteer opportunities.
- Registering for events and tracking their working hours.
- Maintaining profiles with skills, availability, and contact information.
- Logging hours and checking in/out of events to provide real-time participation data.

Additionally, upon event completion, volunteers automatically receive certificates for their work.
